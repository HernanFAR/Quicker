## Quicker

This is a library centred to reduce the ammount of boilerplate code written by a Developer in a proyect.

Ussually, the main functionality structure to apply in most of cases, is the CRUD. I mean, there is  in EVERY PROJECT... so, why not do a OOP aproach to reduce that boilerplate code in a shot ammount of letters? :)

That is the main propourse of this package, serve a aproach to reduce that, in a few abstract classes that do all the work, letting you to center in the important things. Also, this package will help you in the mapping of classes between layers too, of course!

This package use EntityFrameworkCore and AutoMapper to work.

Todo:

- Complete the Service abstractions, and test it in the most of cases
- Complete the Controller Web API abstractions, and test it in the most of cases

Posibble added in future, if there are plausible:

- Add a optional soft delete
- Add abstractions of MVC Controllers
- Add a optional use of Dapper insert of EntityFrameworkCore
